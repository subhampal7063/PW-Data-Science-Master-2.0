        "*****************************\n",
        "Ans:\n",
        "MongoDB is a popular document-oriented NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, called BSON. It is designed to provide high performance, scalability, and flexibility for modern applications that require dynamic, complex data structures.\n",
        "Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are databases that do not use the traditional table-based relational database model used in SQL databases. Instead, they use flexible data models that can handle semi-structured and unstructured data, making them ideal for handling big data and real-time data processing.\n",
        "MongoDB is often preferred over SQL databases in situations where the application requires a high degree of scalability and flexibility, real-time processing of large volumes of unstructured data, and the ability to handle complex data models. It is also well-suited for use in modern web and mobile applications that require fast development cycles and agile data structures."
