        "Ans :\n",
        "Multithreading in Python is a technique where a program is divided into multiple threads of execution that can run concurrently. Each thread is a separate flow of control that can perform a specific task, and the threads share the same memory space, allowing them to communicate and coordinate with each other.\n",
        "\n",
        "Multithreading is used in Python to perform multiple tasks simultaneously and make programs more efficient by utilizing the available hardware resources. It is especially useful in applications that involve I/O operations or other tasks that are blocking, as it allows the program to continue executing other tasks while waiting for the blocked task to complete.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, the threading module is used to handle threads. This module provides a simple and easy-to-use interface for creating and managing threads, with support for features such as thread synchronization, thread-safe data structures, and thread communication. The threading module is part of the standard Python library, so it is available on all platforms where Python is supported."

        "Ans: The threading module in Python is used to create and manage threads in a program. There are several reasons why you might want to use threading in your Python program:\n",
        "\n",
        "Concurrency: Threading allows multiple parts of a program to run concurrently, which can improve the performance and efficiency of the program. By running multiple threads at the same time, the program can utilize the available hardware resources more effectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "Asynchronous I/O: Threading can be used to perform asynchronous I/O operations, where the program can continue executing other tasks while waiting for I/O operations to complete. This can be useful in applications that involve network communication, file I/O, or other types of I/O that are blocking.\n",
        "\n",
        "Parallelism: Threading can be used to perform tasks in parallel, where multiple threads can work on the same task simultaneously. This can be useful in applications that involve heavy computation, as it can reduce the time required to complete the task.\n",
        "\n",
        "Synchronization: Threading provides mechanisms for synchronizing access to shared resources, such as data structures or files, to avoid conflicts and ensure thread safety.\n",
        "\n",
        "activeCount(): The activeCount() function is used to get the number of thread objects that are currently active in the program. This can be useful for monitoring the status of threads and ensuring that all threads have completed before exiting the program.\n",
        "\n",
        "currentThread(): The currentThread() function is used to get a reference to the current thread object that is executing the function. This can be useful for identifying the current thread, and for passing the thread object to other functions for manipulation.\n",
        "\n",
        "enumerate(): The enumerate() function is used to get a list of all thread objects that are currently active in the program. This can be useful for iterating over all active threads and performing operations on them, such as waiting for them to complete or checking their status."
